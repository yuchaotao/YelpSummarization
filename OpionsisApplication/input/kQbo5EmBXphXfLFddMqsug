We/PRP decided/VBD on/IN the/DT Caramel/NNP Apple/NNP Quesadilla/NNP ./.
Are/NNP you/PRP kidding/VBG me/PRP !/RB !/.
So/RB good/JJ !/.
Service/NNP was/VBD polite/JJ even/RB they/PRP were/VBD closing/JJ soon/RB ./.
We/PRP had/VBD a/DT great/JJ lunch/NN at/IN the/DT Cafe/NNP at/IN the/DT Heard/NNP Museum/NNP !/.
Ordered/IN the/DT posole/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD a/DT generous/JJ bowl/NN of/IN pork/hominy/chili/NN soup/NN ./.

But/CC for/IN some/DT reason/NN it/PRP was/VBD served/VBN with/IN an/DT unusually/JJ small/JJ tortilla/NN ./.
The/DT coffee/NN was/VBD excellent/JJ ,/, a/DT flavorful/JJ brew/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ server/NN was/VBD cheerful/JJ and/CC attentive/JJ ./.
The/DT cafe/NN had/VBD a/DT warm/NN inviting/VBG atmosphere/NN and/CC was/VBD doing/VBG a/DT good/JJ business/NN ./.
This/DT cafe/NN is/VBZ far/RB superior/RB to/TO the/DT museum/NN 's/POS previous/JJ cafe/NN ./.
Looking/VBG forward/NN to/TO another/DT lunch/NN here/RB !/.
Cafe/NNP in/IN the/DT museum/NN complex/NN ./.
I/PRP had/VBD the/DT chicken/VBN lime/NN soup/NN which/WDT was/VBD spectacular/JJ ./.
My/NNP friend/NN enjoyed/VBD the/DT hummus/NN veggie/NN wrap/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT little/JJ spendy-/NN $/$ 9/CD for/IN a/DT bowl/NN of/IN soup/NN ./.
But/CC it/PRP was/VBD good/JJ to/TO eat/NN and/CC not/RB have/VB to/TO leave/VB the/DT museum/NN ./.
Beautiful/NNP weather/NN ./.
Clear/NNP blue/JJ skies/NNS ./.
Sunny/NNP and/CC warm/NN out/RP about/IN 70/CD degrees/NNS with/IN a/DT cool/NN breeze/NN ./.
Wonderful/NNP courtyard/NN setting/VBG with/IN fountains/NNS and/CC well/RB manicured/VBD grounds/NNS ./.
Terrific/JJ food/NN and/CC service/NN ./.
Sounds/NNS like/IN a/DT romantic/JJ scene/NN out/IN of/IN a/DT movie/NN ?/.
Too/NNP good/VBD to/TO be/VB true/JJ ?/.
I/PRP would/MD have/VB thought/VBN that/IN too/RB ,/, except/IN I/PRP actually/RB experienced/VBD it/PRP ./.
Definitely/RB not/RB any/DT typical/JJ museum/NN cafe/NN ./.
The/DT menu/NN is/VBZ limited/VBN but/CC what/WP they/PRP offer/VBP is/VBZ an/DT eclectic/JJ selection/NN of/IN gourmet/NN type/NN sandwiches/NNS ,/, appetizers/NNS ,/, and/CC cocktails/NNS ./.
On/IN the/DT day/NN we/PRP visited/VBD it/PRP was/VBD a/DT stunningly/JJ clear/JJ sunny/NN day/NN ./.
Before/NNP heading/NN into/IN the/DT Heard/NNP Museum/NNP we/PRP decided/VBD to/TO grab/NN some/DT lunch/NN here/RB ./.
Perfect/NNP choice/NN !/.
Started/VBN with/IN the/DT prickly/JJ pear/NN lemonade/NN ./.
Only/RB $/$ 3.50/CD for/IN a/DT large/JJ glass/NN and/CC our/PRP$ waiter/NN brought/VBD over/IN a/DT carafe/NN of/IN it/PRP for/IN our/PRP$ table/JJ ./.
We/PRP ordered/VBP two/CD of/IN the/DT most/JJS delicious/JJ sandwiches/NNS ./.
Turkey/NNP ,/, brie/JJ ,/, and/CC sliced/VBD granny/JJ smith/NN apples/NNS on/IN toasted/VBN walnut/NN cranberry/NN bread/NN ./.
Panko/NNP crusted/VBD chicken/VBN sandwich/JJ with/IN fresh/JJ mozzarella/NN ,/, tomato/NN ,/, and/CC pesto/NN sauce/NN on/IN ciabatta/NN bread/NN ./.
Both/DT were/VBD quite/JJ big/JJ and/CC filling/NN for/IN only/RB $/$ 13/CD each/DT ./.
They/PRP came/VBD with/IN a/DT side/NN garden/NN salad/JJ or/CC quinoa/RB salad/JJ ./.
The/DT waiter/NN told/VBD us/PRP the/DT quinoa/NN salad/JJ made/VBN with/IN with/IN black/JJ beans/NNS was/VBD a/DT favorite/JJ and/CC we/PRP could/MD see/VB why/WRB -/JJ it/PRP was/VBD mighty/JJ tasty/NN ./.
This/DT was/VBD like/IN Heaven/NNP ./.
If/IN there/EX were/VBD only/RB some/DT hammocks/NNS or/CC recliners/NNS on/IN the/DT grounds/NNS to/TO take/VB a/DT nap/NN after/IN our/PRP$ meal/NN would/MD have/VB made/VBN it/PRP even/RB better/JJR ./.
It/PRP was/VBD so/RB nice/JJ out/IN we/PRP really/RB did/VBD not/RB want/VB to/TO leave/VB but/CC we/PRP had/VBD to/TO give/VB ourselves/NNS enough/JJ time/NN to/TO view/VB the/DT museum/NN ./.
This/DT has/VBZ to/TO be/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT loveliest/JJS places/NNS to/TO eat/VB in/IN Phoenix/NNP ./.
Indoors/NNS or/CC out/RP in/IN the/DT courtyard/NN ,/, the/DT ambiance/NN is/VBZ top/JJ notch/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN is/VBZ quite/JJ pricey/NN so/IN I/PRP was/VBD very/RB disappointed/JJ to/TO see/VB how/WRB much/JJ they/PRP scrimped/VBD on/IN my/PRP$ salad/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD supposed/VBN to/TO be/VB kale/JJ and/CC greens/NNS ./.
There/EX were/VBD just/RB a/DT few/JJ kale/NN leaves/NNS ./.
I/PRP counted/VBD four/CD pomegranate/NN seeds/NNS and/CC a/DT tiny/NN smattering/NN of/IN walnuts/NNS ./.
For/IN the/DT most/RBS expensive/JJ salad/NN on/IN the/DT menu/NN ,/, it/PRP broke/VBD my/PRP$ heart/NN ./.
Even/RB my/VBD husband/NN 's/POS sandwich/NN ,/, one/CD that/IN he/PRP used/VBD to/TO get/VB at/IN the/DT Heard/NNP North/NNP restaurant/NN ,/, was/VBD not/RB up/RB to/TO par/NN ./.
There/EX was/VBD actually/RB a/DT large/JJ piece/NN of/IN apple/NN core/NN that/IN he/PRP had/VBD to/TO spit/VB out/RP because/IN it/PRP was/VBD not/RB edible/JJ ./.
Lastly/RB ,/, we/PRP lingered/VBD over/IN a/DT coffee/NN and/CC a/DT cookie/NN on/IN the/DT patio/NN after/IN taking/NNS in/IN much/JJ that/IN the/DT museum/NN has/VBZ to/TO offer/NN ./.
The/DT oatmeal/JJ raisin/NN cookie/NN was/VBD awful/JJ ,/, simply/RB awful/JJ ,/, stale/JJ and/CC tasteless/JJ ./.
The/DT café/NN does/VBZ not/RB even/RB have/VB a/DT real/JJ cappuccino/NN machine/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT ridiculous/JJ oversight/NN given/IN the/DT high/JJ price/NN of/IN meals/NNS and/CC the/DT expensive/JJ admission/NN fee/NN ./.
Overall/NNP ,/, for/IN first/JJ time/NN visitors/NNS ,/, it/PRP was/VBD a/DT hugely/RB disappointing/JJ eating/VBG experience/NN ./.
We/PRP ate/VBP inside/JJ this/DT small/JJ cafe/NN ./.
There/EX is/VBZ a/DT large/JJ patio/NN that/WDT has/VBZ shade/NN and/CC sun/NN tables/NNS ./.
This/DT was/VBD a/DT great/JJ lunch/NN spot/NN while/IN taking/VBG a/DT break/NN between/IN a/DT guided/VBN tour/NN and/CC our/PRP$ own/JJ tour/NN ./.
We/PRP had/VBD a/DT bowl/NN of/IN Posole/NNP (/NNP pork/NN ,/, onion/NN ,/, tomatoes/NNS ,/, hominy/NN ,/, pinto/NN beans/NNS ,/, cheese/NN )/NN and/CC a/DT pulled/JJ pork/NN bbq/NN torta/NN sandwich/NN that/WDT came/VBD with/IN a/DT choice/NN of/IN a/DT side/NN salad/NN or/CC corn/NN chips/NNS ./.
Not/RB sure/RB if/IN there/EX was/VBD a/DT choice/NN on/IN the/DT dressing/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP came/VBD with/IN a/DT lite/NN vinagrete/NN kind/NN ./.
The/DT ice/NN tea/NN has/VBZ free/JJ refills/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT diet/NN coke/NN came/VBD in/IN a/DT can/NN ,/, so/RB no/DT complimentary/NN refills/NNS on/IN that/DT ./.
We/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO try/NNP dessert/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP were/VBD too/RB full/JJ and/CC they/PRP closed/VBD at/IN 3pm/CD ,/, so/RB that/IN was/VBD not/RB doable/JJ on/IN this/DT trip/NN ./.
service/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ slow/NN the/DT day/NN we/PRP were/VBD there/RB ,/, but/CC food/NN was/VBD great/JJ ./.
Had/NNP to/TO get/VB a/DT snack/NN wile/NN at/IN the/DT museum/NN ./.
Food/NNP was/VBD ok/JJ but/CC dessert/NN was/VBD sooooo/RB good/JJ fried/VBN bread/JJ sunday/NN ./.
Lunch/NN service/NN was/VBD fairly/RB quick/JJ for/IN a/DT full-service/JJ restaurant/NN (/VBD no/RB more/JJR than/IN 10/CD minutes/NNS wait/JJ )/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN tasted/VBD fine/NN but/CC was/VBD not/RB outstanding/JJ ./.
Ingredients/NNS were/VBD just/RB average/JJ ./.

The/DT venue/NN and/CC decor/NN were/VBD adequate/JJ but/CC not/RB inspiring/VBG ./.
Pricey/NNP but/CC good/JJ ./.
Indoor/NNP and/CC outdoor/NNP seating/NN ./.
Tempery/NNP bean/JJ hummus/NN is/VBZ amazing/VBG but/CC the/DT fried/JJ bread/NN is/VBZ more/RBR like/IN pizza/NN crust/NN ./.
The/DT tacos/NNS are/VBP super/NN for/IN lunch/NN ./.
Gelato/NNP for/IN dessert/NN is/VBZ a/DT nice/JJ treat/NN ./.
Very/NNP pricey/NN and/CC lunch/NN took/VBD a/DT whole/JJ hour/NN (/IN I/PRP was/VBD late/JJ getting/NN back/RB to/TO work/NN and/CC I/PRP work/VBP across/IN the/DT street/NN )/NN ./.
The/DT food/NN was/VBD good/JJ and/CC the/DT service/NN was/VBD pleasant/JJ ,/, but/CC still/RB do/VBP n't/RB see/VB how/WRB a/DT quesadilla/NN 1/CD )/NN costs/NNS $/$ 15/CD and/CC 2/CD )/NN takes/VBZ 40/CD minutes/NNS to/TO cook/NN ./.
A/DT lunch/NN place/NN for/IN the/DT blue/JJ bloods/NNS and/CC blue/JJ hairs/NNS of/IN Phoenix/NNP ./.

Seriously/RB ,/, this/DT is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ lunch/NN spot/NN ,/, whether/IN you/PRP are/VBP visiting/VBG the/DT Heard/NN or/CC not/RB ./.
They/PRP have/VBP a/DT great/JJ outdoor/NN dining/VBG area/NN and/CC service/NN is/VBZ attentive/JJ ./.
Yes/NNS ,/, prices/NNS are/VBP high/JJ ,/, but/CC they/PRP have/VBP a/DT captive/JJ museum/NN audience/NN and/CC can/MD get/VB away/RB with/IN it/PRP ./.
And/CC yes/NNS ,/, everybody/NN there/RB this/DT particular/JJ Sunday/NN was/VBD at/IN least/JJS 20/CD years/NNS older/JJR than/IN me/PRP ./.

Repeating/VBG my/NN review/NN from/IN before/IN .../: this/DT place/NN originally/RB was/VBD run/VBN by/IN the/DT Arcadia/NNP Farms/NNP folks/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT Heard/NNP Museum/NNP has/VBZ now/RB taken/VBN over/IN the/DT operations/NNS directly/RB ./.
